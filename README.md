# Basic Bitmap Fonts

This is a pair of basic image fonts designed for projects such as roguelike games or other graphically simple projects. Both an 8x8 and a 20x15 font are available.

The main motivation for creating this repository is so that I can always find where I've stashed the files for these fonts.

Both fonts start from the space character and advance in ASCII sequence. The 8x8 font contains only characters from 7-bit ASCII, while the 20x15 font contains a number of useful characters from an "extended" ASCII character set.
